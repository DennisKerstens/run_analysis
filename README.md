# run_analysis
Assignment of Course 3

The running of the scripts speaks for itselves as the are explanatory lines added next to the command line.
Just make sure you adjust the correct working directory.
And make sure you have the right data in the working directory.

The column fields are as following:

  person_number  :  this gives the identity of the person which participated in the test
  activity_name  :  this gives the certain activity the person performed
  
  The remainder of the fields are very good explained by the field name itselves.
